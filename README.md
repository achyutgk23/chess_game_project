# 1. Project Introduction <a name="ProjectIntroduction"></a>
This project is an attempt to explore some different aspects of a chess game
to understand their importance and impact on the outcome of a game. In this
project an attempt has been made to  answer the following questions:
- What are the major ways of obtaining each outcome of a game?
- What are the top 10 most used increment codes and which outcome of the game
is dominating each of the top 10 increment codes?
- How many turns were played, on an average, in each of the top 10 increment
codes?
- What are the top 10 most used opening games and which outcome of the game is
dominating each of the top 10 openings?
- How well can we predict an outcome of a game?


# 2. Installations <a name="Installations"></a>
This project uses no other external libraries which doesn't come with basic
installation of Anaconda distribution of python. The python 3 which comes with
basic installation of Anaconda distribution will be sufficient to run the codes.

# 3. File Descriptions <a name="FileDescriptions"></a>
The repository contains,
- one notebook which contains the analysis regarding the above questions.
- A README file which tells about the project and guides users throughout the
project.
- A .py file which contains necessary codes to run the codes in the notebook
without any hassles.
- A csv file of the dataset.

# 4. Results <a name="Results"></a>
The results of the analysis regarding above questions are discussed here.
